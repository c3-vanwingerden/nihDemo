## Objective
â€¯Minority and low-income children have been disproportionately adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; care must be taken to address issues of health equity regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials and allocation.
    
## Design
SARS-CoV-2 patterns were assessed using a range of indicators from high risk children.

## Subjects/setting
A sample of low-income children below the age of 10 (n = 3450) was selected.
    
## Statistical analysis
Because COVID-19 is minimally symptomatic in the vast majority of children, a higher acceptable risk threshold is required when evaluating pediatric clinical trials. Profound differences in innate and adaptive immunity during childhood and adolescence are known to affect vaccine responsiveness for a variety of childhood diseases. COVID-19 and the accompanying social disruption, such as the school shutdowns, has been disproportionately damaging to minority and low-income children.
    
## Results 
A total of 147 published papers were found on SARS-CoV-2 in general populations, 48 full-text articles that involved children were published between January 1, 2020 and April, 1 2020 and 44 considered relevant were reviewed for this study.
